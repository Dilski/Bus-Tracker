# Bus-Tracker

[Uses the "my bus tracker" api.](http://www.mybustracker.co.uk?page=API%20Key) You'll need to get an api key, find your bus stop ID and service ID (this is not the service number, for example the ID of service 25 is 69)

Simple project that shows how long until the next bus of a service at a bus stop.

I plan to use a different display method, have suppoort for times over 10 minutes long and multiple bus services.
